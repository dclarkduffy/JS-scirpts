# JS scripts
 This is a random collection of javascript files I've created. Some for fun, study and live interviews.

## HackerRank Challenges

   - **sherlockString.js**:	 *Two strings are anagrams of each other if the letters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string. Given a string, find the number of pairs of substrings of the string that are anagrams of each other.* 

   - **makeAnagram.js**:	*Given two strings, s1 and s2, that may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make s1 and s2 anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.* 

   - **newYearChaos.js**:	*It is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue from 1 to n . Any person can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions, but they still wear their original sticker. One person can bribe at most two others. Determine the minimum number of bribes that took place to get to a given queue order. Print the number of bribes, or, if anyone has bribed more than two people, print Too chaotic.*
